Introduction
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive linguistic analysis of a Ph.D. dissertation using advanced text mining and natural language processing techniques. By employing a diverse set of analytical methods, including word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition, and readability assessment, among others, the study seeks to uncover deeper insights into the dissertation’s content, structure, and stylistic features. This multi-faceted approach will not only provide a quantitative understanding of the text but also offer qualitative insights into the dissertation’s themes, coherence, and overall academic contribution. The project’s findings are expected to demonstrate the potential of computational linguistics in enhancing the evaluation and understanding of complex academic texts, potentially paving the way for more sophisticated tools in academic writing and assessment.

A. Summary of the Dissertation
My Ph.D. dissertation, titled “Narrowing English Learner (EL) Achievement Gaps: A Multilevel Analysis of an EL-Infused Teacher Preparation Model,” (https://stars.library.ucf.edu/etd2020/216/) focuses on addressing the academic disparities experienced by English Learners (ELs) through an innovative teacher preparation framework. Guided by Dr. Joyce W. Nutta, this research employs multilevel statistical methods to analyze the effectiveness of a teacher preparation model specifically designed to enhance the teaching strategies for ELs. The study integrates various factors such as teacher education, instructional methods, and educational policies, aiming to develop a comprehensive understanding of how tailored teacher preparation can significantly improve ELs’ academic outcomes. Through this analysis, the dissertation contributes to the field of TESOL by providing data-driven insights and practical recommendations for teacher education programs, ultimately seeking to close the achievement gaps for EL students.
